## by Moamen Abdelkawy

This project is a very simple mock-up bottom-up financial forecasting using MS Excel. It studies four Nasdaq companies: 
1. Navient Corp. (NAVI)
2. PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL)
3. Qorvo Inc. (QRVO)
4. WestRock Co. (WRK)

The forecasts resulted from a scenario based analysis, and predicts the performance for two years based on three years of historic data.
